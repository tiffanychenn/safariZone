# final-project
Our final project for APCS2

List of Features
1. Catching Pokemon, with a choice of throwing bait, mud, or a ball. Bait will make it harder to catch but less likely to run, mud will make it easier to catch but more likely to run, and the ball will attempt to capture the Pokemon depending on the modified catch rate.
2. Six different terrains, each with 10 different Pokemon to catch when walking in tall grass.
3. Pretty overworld in Processing, with working avatar that walks to different terrains in the overworld. Screen changing effects when an encounter occurs and animations while in “battle.” //not completed yet
4. Pokedex to check description of captured Pokemon //not completed yet
5. Ability to change avatar and save sessions //not completed yet
6. Music playing //not completed yet
